Examples for Learning Leap.js


The Examples will be structured in the following manner:

Beginner:

  FRAMES:

  This is the most basic example, and will simply show you how to start grabbing frame data from the Leap Motion device.
  
  *FILE NAME*               *TEACHES YOU TO*

  connecting.html           //TODO: Connect the leap
  timestamp.html            //TODO: Understand the timeStamp data
  interactionBox.html       //TODO: Show the interaction Box

  frameExample.html         //TODO: Fun example on how to use all the frame data



  POINTABLES:

  We will start with the pointable data, which will be used to introduce the frame data. By going through these first few examples you will be able to understand how to use the multitude of useful tools attached to the pointable data.

  *FILE NAME*               *TEACHES YOU TO*

  fingerPositions.html      // Draw fingers on the page
  stabilizedPositions.html  // Show stabilized and normal tipPositions
  touchPlane.html           // Show the Touch Plane Information
  fingerVelocites.html      // TODO: draw fingerVelocities
  fingerDirections.html     // TODO: draw fingerDirections

  fingerExample.html        // TODO: A fun example using all the things we learned



  HANDS:

  In addition to pointables, we also get data attached to the hand. The next few examples will show you how to access this data.

  *FILE NAME*               *TEACHES YOU TO*

  palmPositions.html        // Draw fingers and hands on the page
  palmDirections.html       // TODO: draw palmDirections and palmNormals

  palmExample.html          // TODO: Shows off all the things we have just learned



  GESTURES:

  Learning these few high level gestures will let you build effortless interfaces with very little effort.

  *FILE NAME*               *TEACHES YOU TO*

  circleGesture.html        //TODO: Draw a circle Gesture
  swipeGesture.html         //TODO: Draw a swipe Gesture
  screenTapGesture.html     //TODO: Draw a screenTap Gesture
  keyTapGesture.html        //TODO: Draw a keyTap Gesture

  gestureExample.html       //TODO: Shows of all the gestures



  MOTIONS:

  The Motions API allows you another way to quickly and easily get physical data using the Leap Motion Device.

  *FILE NAME*               *TEACHES YOU TO*

  scale.html                //TODO: Show Scaling
  translation.html          //TODO: Show Transtlation
  rotation.html             //TODO: Show Rotation

  motionsExample.html       //TODO: Shows of all the Motions



  Z - INDEX:

  Probably the most magic part of the Leap Motion device is that it gives you a whole new dimension of interaction. Although its may seem a bit daunting if you have never used 3D graphics, we will use a phenomenal library: THREE.JS to make it all more managable.

  *FILE NAME*               *TEACHES YOU TO*

  fingers3D.html            //TODO: Show Fingers in 3D space
  hands3D.html              //TODO: Show Handss in 3D space
  gestures3D.html           //TODO: Show Gestures in 3D space
  motions3D.html            //TODO: Show Motions in 3D space

  example3D.html            //TODO: Show awesome example in 3D space



  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER:

  Now that we have worked through all these different examples, lets put them to use in a few interactive examples.

  glsl.html                 //TODO: Pulls in Leap Motion data in order to create
                            // a beautiful, colorful, visualizer

  scrollInterface.html      //TODO: Allows user to scroll through information
                            // and effortlessly select what they want to view

  snake3D.html              //TODO: A basic snake game where a user collects 
                            // blocks simply by touching them in mid air
